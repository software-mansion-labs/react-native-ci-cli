## ü§î Why?

The problem we noticed is that setting up CI is performed once, needs to be researched every time, and is often trial and error driven. The process is repetitive. 

We created a tool that bootstraps CI with the most used features, which are ready for customization in the future. When you run `npx setup-ci` React Native CI CLI generates GitHub workflows for the most popular CI tasks. 

## üìñ Usage

Simply go to your project root directory and run:

```
npx setup-ci
```

then select the setup that matches your project - React Native CI CLI generates workflows and tries to add missing configs and install necessary dependencies.

If your project has a monorepo structure, run the script from the root directory of the app for which you want to set up workflows.

## üí° Demo

Say we want to set up GitHub actions that run ESLint check and Jest tests on our project every time we create or push to an existing Pull Request.
Let's try to use `react-native-ci-cli` to do the heavy lifting and generate all the necessary configurations.

</p>

Alternatively, we can go fully automatic by passing flags `--preset --lint --jest` to avoid all interaction with the script. You can check the section below for more information about available flags!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Currently, only GitHub actions are supported as your CI.**
- **npm** and **yarn** are supported as package managers, and they will be detected automatically.
- Monorepo structure is supported, but make sure you run the script from the app directory,
  not the monorepo root.

When using `react-native-ci-cli`, you can provide additional flags to modify its default behavior.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th width="160px" style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Flag</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--preset</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Run the script with your own preset. Combine it with feature flags to specify what workflows you want to generate.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--skip-git-check</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">By default, the script will prompt the user if there are uncommitted changes in the working repository. Use this flag to proceed without asking.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following are **feature flags** that can be used with `--preset` flag (they are ignored if `--preset` is not provided).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Flag</th>
    <th style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--lint</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate ESLint workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--jest</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Jest workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--ts</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Typescript check workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--prettier</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Prettier check workflow to run on every PR</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--eas-update</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate Preview with EAS Update workflow to run on every PR (Expo projects only)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">--detox</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Generate workflow to run Detox e2e tests on every PR</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## üîê Repository secrets

Some workflows generated by `react-native-ci-cli` require setting up repository secrets that can be then accessed by workflows as `${{ secrets.* }}`. Make sure to read logs printed by the script
as you will always be prompted to create secrets if necessary. The following table shows a summary of secrets you might have to create for generated workflows to work properly.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; font-weight: bold">Secret</td>
    <td style="text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; font-weight: bold">Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">EXPO_TOKEN</td>
    <td style="vertical-align: middle;">Used for authentication in workflows using your Expo account. Learn more at <a href=https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/github-actions>Expo with GitHub actions</a>.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
