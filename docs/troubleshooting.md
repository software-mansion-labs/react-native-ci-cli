#### Missing runtime version from app.json/app.config.js

If during `setup-ci` execution you see one of the following errors: `Error: A runtime version is set in your AndroidManifest.xml,
but is missing from your app.json/app.config.js.` or
`Error: [ios.expoPlist]: withIosExpoPlistBaseMod: A runtime version is set in your Expo.plist, but is missing from your app.json/app.`, you either need to remove `android/` and `ios/`
directories in your project and re-run (if your project is using [CNG](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/continuous-native-generation/))
or add `runtimeVersion` field to your `app.json`/`app.config.js` file.
